Welcome to the **Scalable Web App** repository! This project demonstrates how to build a scalable web application using AWS services, Terraform, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Auto Scaling. This guide will walk you through the architecture, setup, and deployment of the application.

## Overview

This project leverages the power of AWS to create a robust and scalable web application. By using Terraform, we can manage our infrastructure as code, making it easy to deploy and manage resources consistently. The application is designed to handle variable loads, thanks to the Auto Scaling feature and the Application Load Balancer.

## Architecture

The architecture of the scalable web app consists of several key components:

- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers that host the web application.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for the application.

Here‚Äôs a diagram to illustrate the architecture:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account.
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and Terraform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Scalable Web App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devilonearth/scalable-web-app.git
   cd scalable-web-app
   ```

2. Set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by configuring the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Modify the Terraform configuration files as needed. These files are located in the `terraform` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, run the following commands:

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Validate the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. Plan the deployment:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Usage

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your web application through the Application Load Balancer's DNS name. You can find this DNS name in the AWS Management Console under the EC2 section.

To view the application logs, connect to the EC2 instances via SSH and check the Nginx logs located at `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.
